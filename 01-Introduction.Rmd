# 1.1 An Introduction to NatureCounts {#intro}

NatureCounts is a website hosted and managed by Birds Canada, Canada’s leading scientific non-government organization dedicated to increasing the understanding, appreciation and conservation of wild birds and their habitats (www.birdscanada.org).  Birds Canada specializes in citizen science long-term monitoring programs using a partnership-based model.  Citizen science has been found to be the most cost-effective way to monitor bird populations across large geographic areas. In Canada, over 16,000 volunteers are currently involved in Birds Canada’s programs. 

Launched in January 2008, Nature Counts (www.naturecounts.ca) is the first Canadian node of the Avian Knowledge Network (www.avianknowledge.net). It serves as an online data dissemination portal to facilitate the collection, management and sharing of biological data.  NatureCounts hosts hundreds of datasets, representing well over 100 million occurrences of birds. These include virtually all of Birds Canada’s monitoring initiatives, such as Breeding Bird Atlases, eBird Canada, the Marsh Monitoring Program, Nocturnal Owl Surveys, as well as many other major initiatives to which Birds Canada contributes in some capacity (e.g., Canadian Migration Monitoring Program, Hawk Count and the Raptor Population Index,Monarch Knowledge Network, the Breeding Bird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, Project FeederWatch). 

What can you do with the data?
-	You can explore the data resources of NatureCounts via interactive maps that allow you to view the distribution of bird populations during any time of the year and across a variety of different sources. 
-	You can obtain and visualize information on long term population trends of Canadian birds.
-	You can explore an individual species pattern of distribution or the species richness of a location via dynamically generated summary tables and graphs.
-	Finally, much of the observational data can be directly accessed and downloaded for your own personal research!

# 1.2 NatureCounts and R {#introR}

The natuecounts R package was create to allow users to directly access and download data from NatureCounts into R. The goal of this online ‘handbook’ is to show NatureCounts users how to use the R statistical programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) to access, filter, summarize, and visualize naturecounts data. We also intend to create more advanced turtoials which explore various analytical procedures. 

The naturecounts R package described herein is under continual development, and the intent of this online ‘handbook’ is to help users learn the various functionalities of the package, and potentially contribute to it. We also show how additional R packages such as ggplot can be used to explore, visualize, transform, and analyze Motus data.

If you have suggestions for additional content, please let us know by emailing dethier@birdscanada.org.

Some of the text included in this book was adapted from the naturecounts GitHub repository developed by Steffi LaZerte: https://github.com/BirdStudiesCanada/naturecounts. Many people have worked together to make the NatureCounts web interface and the R-package together. The core ‘Motus Team’ includes Joey Bernard, John Brzustowski, Tara Crewe, Zoe Crysler, Jeremy Hussell, Catherine Jardine, Steffi LaZerte, Denis Lepage, Stuart Mackenzie, Paul Morrill, and Philip Taylor.

The development of the NatureCounts web interface, R package, and accompanying handbook were made possible through a Canarie grant to Bird Studies Canada (https://www.canarie.ca/). Motus continues to grow as a program of Bird Studies Canada, through the collaboration of numerous independent researchers, organizations, and individuals.
